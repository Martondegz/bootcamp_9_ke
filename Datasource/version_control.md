## Version Control

Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large wesites and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code (each commit message usually has a hash code).  


####Questions:  
1. How to format commit messages  
> for instances of the first commit, the message commonly is minimal thus 'Initial commit'.  
> When versioning a large number of files, best practices adivice to include a commit head and body. This is achieved as so: when staging the files ready for a commit, one should do a 'git commit' without a message which prompts an editor. The head and body is seperated via the structure (at least two spaces or lines apart)  

2. How big should be a commit size  
> All commits should handle a single case, commits should be organized logically and be specific.  

3. formatting readme files.  
> Read me files have vaious formatting ways including markdown. A readme should include the project's requirements and steps towards usage. An example of a formatted readme file defined [here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress)
